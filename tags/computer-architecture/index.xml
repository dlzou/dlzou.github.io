Although it was just an empirical observation at the time, it held true for the next several decades as computers went from slow behemoths to the ubiquitous, powerful devices they are today.

Sure, trying to write and debug assembly instructions as a beginner is painful, but it has given me incredible perspective. After years of coding, this may be the first time I&amp;rsquo;m truly wowed by computers&amp;hellip; And even more so by humans.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
