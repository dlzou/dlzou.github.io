I'm an undergrad at UC Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, and I love working on smart and powerful software.

As a student, I'm using my coursework to navigate the intersection between AI, data science, and performance systems. As an undergrad researcher, I'm dipping my toes into the sorts of work that push the boundaries of computing. As a perpetual learner, I enjoy exploring projects and pursuits at my own pace. Then, there are times when I step back and reflect on the insights I've gained on my journey; some of that is documented here on this site.

When I'm away from my computer, there's a good chance I'm at my piano or on a tennis court.

I am **@dlzou** on [GitHub](https://github.com/dlzou) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dlzou).\
