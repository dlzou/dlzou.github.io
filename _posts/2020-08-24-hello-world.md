... As the CS tradition goes. Since this is my first post, it feels natural to start by explaining how this personal website came to be and what I plan to do with it. "But it's just a portfolio website?" Yeah... but I have more in mind. Please, have a seat.

### 2020

Let's begin with the big picture. 2020 has been one of the most chaotic years in recent history by many standards, and it's certainly *the* most chaotic year I've yet to through. So much is happening in the world---pandemic, elections, disasters, protests---but after staying home day after day, sometimes there seems to be so little to do, and even though I'm lucky enough to not face any financial hardships, lockdown still takes its toll over time. Socialization is irreplaceable after all. 

But over the past few months, I've found that there's still something to be gained from this change of pace. Being alone with my thoughts is weirdly liberating in a way.
