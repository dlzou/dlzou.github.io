Those who have met me or read my other posts on this site know that I'm enthusiastic about all sorts of technology, especially when it comes to new, revolutionary concepts dealing with computers. Cryptocurrency is an exception. Over the past few years, I've been slowly reading and learning about what they are, what they promise, and what critics say, and I've come to the conclusion that in their current form, cryptocurrencies are a fad at best, and at worst, a scourge on society.

## Why It Won't Work

### Conflict of Interest
I'm starting with this more neutral argument that's not really a downside of cryptos, but rather a strong factor opposing their growth. Governments.
We live in a society.

### Unreliability
price
No regulation, accountability,  assistance
security
51% attack, Ghash.io

### Psychology
Gambling
Get rich quick
No value created
Driven by hope
Mob mentality
Class war

### Wastefulness
High volume of transactions
GPU shortage
power consumption (link to Moore's Law article)
unsustainable for environment
