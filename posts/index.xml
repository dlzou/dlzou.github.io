This chance find has since led me on a journey of writing a solo piano arrangement. Score included in this post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond Moore's Law</title><link>https://dlzou.github.io/2021/05/16/beyond-moores-law/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dlzou.github.io/2021/05/16/beyond-moores-law/</guid><description>&lt;p>Back in the 60&amp;rsquo;s, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">famously predicted&lt;/a> that the number of transistors we can fit on a computer chip will double about every two years, with the implication that the speed of computers will grow just as fast. Although it was just an empirical observation at the time, it held true for the next several decades as computers went from slow behemoths to the ubiquitous, powerful devices they are today. However&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Computers and Humans</title><link>https://dlzou.github.io/2020/09/27/computers-and-humans/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dlzou.github.io/2020/09/27/computers-and-humans/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently started learning &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V">RISC-V&lt;/a> assembly in &lt;a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS61C/">CS 61C&lt;/a>, and I must say, getting closer to the metal has been a transformative experience. Sure, trying to write and debug assembly instructions as a beginner is painful, but it has given me incredible perspective. After years of coding, this may be the first time I&amp;rsquo;m truly wowed by computers&amp;hellip; And even more so by humans.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deep NLP Chatbot Using a Seq2Seq Model</title><link>https://dlzou.github.io/2020/08/30/deep-nlp-chatbot-using-a-seq2seq-model/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dlzou.github.io/2020/08/30/deep-nlp-chatbot-using-a-seq2seq-model/</guid><description>&lt;p>Machine learning (ML) has been the tech buzzword of the decade. I first heard the term in reference to DeepMind&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">legendary Go program&lt;/a>, and it&amp;rsquo;s been on my radar ever since. This summer, I tackled a project to build a &lt;a href="https://github.com/dlzou/dnlp-chatbot">chatbot program&lt;/a> that can respond to English human dialogue inputs with sentences. Sounds simple (it sure did to me at first), but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot under the hood.

Since this is my first post, it feels natural to start by explaining how this website came to be and what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do with it. &amp;ldquo;But it&amp;rsquo;s just a portfolio website?&amp;rdquo; Yeah&amp;hellip; but I have bit more in mind. Please, have a seat.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
