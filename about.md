I'm an undergrad student at UC Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, and I love developing smart and powerful software. As a research assistant at Berkeley's RISELab, I'm dipping my toes into the sorts of work that push the boundaries of computing. I also enjoy doing side projects that let me navigate new topics at my own pace. Then, there are times when I step back and reflect on the things I've learned and insights I've gained on my journey; some of that is documented here on this site.

When I'm away from my computer, you may find me by my piano or on a tennis court.

I am **@dlzou** on [GitHub](https://github.com/dlzou) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dlzou).\
You can also contact me through **dlzou at berkeley dot edu**.
