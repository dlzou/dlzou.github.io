I'm a student currently attending UC Berkeley, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. My main academic interests are artificial intelligence and software architecture. However, I tinker with all sorts of ideas involving software and/or hardware.

I am **@dlzou** on [GitHub](https://github.com/dlzou) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dlzou).\
You can also send me important messages at **dlzou at berkeley dot edu**.
