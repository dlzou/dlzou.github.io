I'm a student currently attending UC Berkeley, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. I love developing smarter and more efficient software, and my interests include systems, algorithm design, and AI. I'm pursuing research and teaching, but I also often work on personal projects outside of school because I enjoy exploring new topics at my own pace. I believe the process is just as meaningful as the final product, so on this site, I write about the things I learn and insights I gain on my journey.

When I'm away from my computer, you can probably find me by my piano or on a tennis court.

I am **@dlzou** on [GitHub](https://github.com/dlzou) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dlzou).\
For serious inquiries, please email **dlzou at berkeley dot edu**.
